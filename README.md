- **Clean Architecture**  
  Layered architecture (`presentation`, `domain`, `data`) ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.

  Modularized project (`app`, `core`, `feature`, `common`, etc.) for better code isolation and faster build times.

- **Paging 3 Library**  
  Efficient infinite scroll with automatic data loading, error handling, and UI updates.

- **Navigation Component**  
  Simplified navigation and safe argument passing with support for nested navigation graphs.

- **Version Catalog**  
  Centralized dependency management using `libs.versions.toml` for better maintainability.

- **Convention Plugins**  
  Custom Gradle plugins to enforce consistent build configurations and reduce boilerplate.
